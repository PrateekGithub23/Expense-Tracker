You're doing great so far — your implementation of CRUD and basic filtering is clean and functional! Now, for the remaining functions (filters, analysis, utility), here's what **each function** will do in detail, using your pattern of `from database import connect, close_connection` — **without giving code**, just purpose and logic.

---

### ✅ 6. `get_expenses_by_category(category)`

**Purpose:** Retrieve all expenses that belong to a specific category.

**What it will do:**

* Connect to the database.
* Run `SELECT * FROM expenses WHERE category = ?`.
* Return or print all matching rows.
* Useful to analyze or view category-wise spending (like Food, Travel, Bills).

---

### ✅ 7. `get_expenses_between_dates(start_date, end_date)`

**Purpose:** Fetch all expenses recorded between two specific dates.

**What it will do:**

* Accept `start_date` and `end_date` in format like `YYYY-MM-DD`.
* Run a query using `WHERE date BETWEEN ? AND ?`.
* Return a list of expenses sorted (optionally) by date.
* Helps analyze spending over a time range (e.g., weekly/monthly reviews).

---

### ✅ 8. `search_expenses(keyword)`

**Purpose:** Perform a search across notes and categories using a keyword.

**What it will do:**

* Use SQL `LIKE` operator to find entries where `note` or `category` contains the keyword.
* Allow flexible, case-insensitive search like “Starbucks”, “bus”, or “grocery”.
* Run: `WHERE note LIKE ? OR category LIKE ?`.

---

### ✅ 9. `get_total_spent()`

**Purpose:** Calculate the total money spent across all entries.

**What it will do:**

* Use aggregation: `SELECT SUM(amount) FROM expenses`.
* Return a single number representing total spending.
* Useful for dashboards or setting limits.

---

### ✅ 10. `get_total_spent_by_category(category)`

**Purpose:** Get total expenses under a single category.

**What it will do:**

* Run `SELECT SUM(amount) FROM expenses WHERE category = ?`.
* Return how much was spent in that category.
* Helps track where you're spending the most (e.g., "Food" totals \$200).

---

### ✅ 11. `get_daily_spending_summary()`

**Purpose:** Provide daily totals of spending.

**What it will do:**

* Group all records by `date`, then sum `amount` per date.
* Query: `SELECT date, SUM(amount) FROM expenses GROUP BY date ORDER BY date`.
* Display or return a list like:

  ```
  2025-05-08: $23.50
  2025-05-09: $12.00
  ```

---

### ✅ 12. `get_monthly_summary(year, month)`

**Purpose:** Summarize all expenses for a given year and month.

**What it will do:**

* Accept parameters like `2025` and `05` (May).
* Use `WHERE date LIKE '2025-05%'` or extract month using SQL substrings.
* Return total spending or breakdown by category/date for that month.

---

### ✅ 13. `get_top_spending_categories(limit=5)`

**Purpose:** List the top N categories where you've spent the most money.

**What it will do:**

* Use `GROUP BY category`, `SUM(amount)`, then `ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC`.
* Apply `LIMIT ?` to get top 5 (or user-defined) categories.
* Shows where most of your money is going.

---

### ✅ 14. `export_expenses_to_csv(filename)`

**Purpose:** Save all expenses into a CSV file for backup or reporting.

**What it will do:**

* Connect to the DB and fetch all rows.
* Use Python’s `csv` module to write rows into a file.
* First row will be headers like `['ID', 'Name', 'Amount', 'Category', 'Note', 'Date']`.

---

### ✅ 15. `reset_all_data(confirm=False)`

**Purpose:** Delete all expense data (e.g., for resetting or starting fresh).

**What it will do:**

* If `confirm == True`, execute `DELETE FROM expenses`.
* Otherwise, ask the user for confirmation.
* Can optionally also vacuum the database to recover space.
